# LinearAlgebraRectangle
A small rendering project for a thrown rectangle simulation.

Controls:
- Left Mouse Button + Move Mouse to move the camera.
- Mouse Scroll to zoom in or out.

- Up and Down Arrow keys to play or reverse simulation.
- Left and Right Arrow keys to slow down or speed up simulation.

- Space to pause or resume simulation.
- Backspace to go to begining.

Settings:
- In the settings.ini you can modify x-value in "iValue=x". Note: intended for values 1-9. 295 looks pretty dope, though.
